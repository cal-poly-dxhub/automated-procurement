Human: Thank you, that looks great! Just one small clarification - for the hardware delivery terms in section 3.1, could you please change it to EXW (Ex Works) instead of DAP?

You: the key deliverables are as follows: the first deliverable is that the partner is to remove the old infrastructure from the old internet service provider (1). then they are to put in their routers and check that they work (2). then they are to put in all of the wireless extenders and reuse old extenders if necessary (3). then they are to check speeds and make sure they are greater than 10 gb/s (4). then they are to do robustness testing (5)
